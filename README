MARC::Record and its family
===========================

SYNOPSIS

The MARC::* series of modules create a simple object-oriented 
abstraction of MARC record handling.  The files are:

MARC::Tutorial
    A tutorial explaining how to use MARC::Record.

MARC::Record
    The core class for representing a single MARC record.

MARC::Field
    Another core class for representing a single field in a record.

MARC::Batch
    The basic object for access to a batch of one or more MARC records.

MARC::File
    Base class for the MARC file.

MARC::File::USMARC
MARC::File::MicroLIF
    Subclasses of MARC::File specific to the USMARC and MicroLIF formats

MARC::Lint
    Extension to check MARC records for validity.
    

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DEPENDENCIES

If you would like to run MARC::Record under a Perl version that is earlier than 
v5.006 there is a patch which you can apply prior to installing:

    tar xvfz MARC-Record-1.XX.tar.gz
    cd MARC-Record-1.XX
    patch -p1 < pre5006.patch

MARC::* requires Perl and Test::More for tests. Test::More comes standard in
Perl 5.8.

Tests are known to fail under Perl 5.6.0. We recommend you upgrade to a later
version of Perl, or downgrade to an earlier one if you want to use
MARC::Record. Perl 5.6.0 is known to have been an unstable release of Perl,
which was quickly rectified in 5.6.1 and later releases.
