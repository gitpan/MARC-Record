=head1 DESCRIPTION

Module for handling MARC records as objects.  The file-handling stuff is
in MARC::File::*.

=head1 EXPORT

None.  

=head1 ERROR HANDLING

Any errors generated are stored in C<$MARC::Record::ERROR>. 
Warnings are kept with the record and accessible in the C<warnings()> method. 

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Base constructor for the class.  It just returns a completely empty record.
To get real data, you'll need to populate it with fields, or use one of
the MARC::File::* modules to read from a file.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    $class = ref($class) || $class; # Handle cloning
    my $self = {
	_leader => ' ' x 24,
	_fields => [],
	_warnings => [],
    };
    return bless $self, $class;
} # new()

=head2 new_from_usmarc( $marcblob )

This is a wrapper around C<MARC::File::USMARC::decode()> for compatibility with
older versions of MARC::Record.

=cut

sub new_from_usmarc {
    my $blob = shift;
    $blob = shift if (ref($blob) || ($blob eq "MARC::Record"));

    require MARC::File::USMARC;

    return MARC::File::USMARC::decode( $blob );
}

=head2 fields()

Returns a list of all the fields in the record. The list contains 
a MARC::Field object for each field in the record.

=cut

sub fields() {
    my $self = shift;
    return @{$self->{_fields}};
}

=head2 field(tagspec(s))

Returns a list of tags that match the field specifier, or in scalar
context, just the first matching tag.

The field specifier can be a simple number (i.e. "245"), or use the "." 
notation of wildcarding (i.e. subject tags are "6..").

=cut

my %field_regex;

sub field {
    my $self = shift;
    my @specs = @_;

    my @list = ();
    for my $tag ( @specs ) {
	my $regex = $field_regex{ $tag };

	# Compile & stash it if necessary
	if ( not defined $regex ) {
	    $regex = qr/^$tag$/;
	    $field_regex{ $tag } = $regex;
	} # not defined

	for my $maybe ( $self->fields ) {
	    if ( $maybe->tag =~ $regex ) {
		return $maybe unless wantarray;

		push( @list, $maybe );
	    } # if
	} # for $maybe
    } # for $tag

    return @list;
}

=head2 subfield(tag,subfield)

Shortcut method for getting just a subfield for a tag.  These are equivalent:

  my $title = $marc->field('245')->subfield("a");
  my $title = $marc->subfield('245',"a");

If either the field or subfield can't be found, C<undef> is returned.

=cut

sub subfield {
    my $self = shift;
    my $tag = shift;
    my $subfield = shift;

    my $field = $self->field($tag) or return undef;
    return $field->subfield($subfield);
} # subfield()

=head2 insert_grouped_field(field)

Will insert the specified MARC::Field object into the record in 'grouped
order' and return true (1) on success, and false (undef) on failure.
For example, if a '650' field is inserted with insert_grouped_field()
it will be inserted at the end of the 6XX group of tags. After some discussion
on the perl4lib list it was descided that this is ordinarily what you will 
want. If you would like to insert at a specific point in the record you can use 
insert_fields_after() and insert_fields_before() methods which are described 
below. 

=cut 

sub insert_grouped_field {
    my ($self,$new) = @_;
    _all_parms_are_fields($new) or croak('Argument must be MARC::Field object');

    ## try to find the end of the field group and insert it there
    my $limit = int($new->tag() / 100);
    my $found = 0;
    foreach my $field ($self->fields()) {
	if ( int($field->tag() / 100) > $limit ) {
	    $self->insert_fields_before($field,$new);
	    $found = 1;
	    last;
	}
    }

    ## if we couldn't find the end of the group, then we must not have 
    ## any tags this high yet, so just append it
    if (!$found) {
	$self->append_fields($new); 
    }

    return(1);

}

=for internal

=cut

sub _all_parms_are_fields {
    for ( @_ ) {
	return 0 unless ref($_) eq 'MARC::Field';
    }
    return 1;
}

=head2 append_fields(@fields)

Appends the field specified by C<$field> to the end of the record. 
C<@fields> need to be MARC::Field objects.

    my $field = MARC::Field->new('590','','','a' => 'My local note.');
    $record->append_fields($field);

Returns the number of fields appended.

=cut

sub append_fields {
    my $self = shift;

    _all_parms_are_fields(@_) or croak('Arguments must be MARC::Field objects');

    push(@{ $self->{_fields} }, @_); 
    return scalar @_;
}

=head2 insert_fields_before($before_field,@new_fields)

Inserts the field specified by C<$new_field> before the field C<$before_field>.
Returns the number of fields inserted, or undef on failures.
Both C<$before_field> and all C<@new_fields> need to be MARC::Field objects.

    my $before_field = $record->field('260');
    my $new_field = MARC::Field->new('250','','','a' => '2nd ed.');
    $record->insert_fields_before($before_field,$new_field);

=cut

sub insert_fields_before {
    my $self = shift;

    _all_parms_are_fields(@_) 
	or croak('All arguments must be MARC::Field objects');

    my ($before,@new) = @_;

    ## find position of $before
    my $fields = $self->{_fields};
    my $pos = 0;
    foreach my $f (@$fields) {
	last if ($f == $before);
	$pos++;
    }

    ## insert before $before 
    if ($pos >= @$fields) {
	$self->_warn("Couldn't find field to insert before");
	return(undef);
    }
    splice(@$fields,$pos,0,@new);
    return scalar @new;

}

=head2 insert_fields_after($after_field,@new_fields)

Identical to C<insert_fields_before()>, but fields are added after 
C<$after_field>.

=cut

sub insert_fields_after {
    my $self = shift;

    _all_parms_are_fields(@_) or croak('All arguments must be MARC::Field objects');
    my ($after,@new) = @_;

    ## find position of $after
    my $fields = $self->{_fields};
    my $pos = 0;
    foreach my $f (@$fields) {
	last if ($f == $after);
	$pos++;
    }

    ## insert after $after
    if ($pos+1 >= @$fields) { 
	$self->_warn("Couldn't find field to insert after");
	return(undef);
    }
    splice(@$fields,$pos+1,0,@new);
    return scalar @new;
}

=head2 delete_field($field)

Deletes a field from the record.

The field must have been retrieved from the record using the 
C<field()> method.  For example, to delete a 526 tag if it exists:

    my $tag526 = $marc->field( "526" );
    if ( $tag526 ) {
	$marc->delete_field( $tag526 );
    }

C<delete_field()> returns the number of fields that were deleted.
This shouldn't be 0 unless you didn't get the tag properly.

=cut

sub delete_field {
    my $self = shift;
    my $deleter = shift;
    my $list = $self->{_fields};

    my $old_count = @$list;
    @$list = grep { $_ != $deleter } @$list;
    return $old_count - @$list;
}

=head2 as_usmarc()

This is a wrapper around C<MARC::File::USMARC::encode()> for compatibility with
older versions of MARC::Record.

=cut

sub as_usmarc() {
    my $self = shift;

    require MARC::File::USMARC;

    return MARC::File::USMARC::encode( $self );
}

=head2 as_formatted()

Returns a pretty string for printing in a MARC dump.

=cut

sub as_formatted() {
    my $self = shift;
	    
    my @lines = ( "LDR " . ($self->{_leader} || "") );
    for my $field ( @{$self->{_fields}} ) {
	    push( @lines, $field->as_formatted() );
    }

    return join( "\n", @lines );
} # as_formatted

=head2 title()

Returns the title from the 245 tag.
Note that it is a string, not a MARC::Field record.

=cut

sub title() {
    my $self = shift;

    my $field = $self->field(245) or return "<no 245 tag found>";

    return $field->as_string;
}

=head2 author()

Returns the author from the 100, 110 or 111 tag.
Note that it is a string, not a MARC::Field record.

=cut

sub author() {
    my $self = shift;

    for my $tag ( qw( 100 110 111 ) ) {
	my $field = $self->field($tag);
	return $field->as_string() if $field;
    }

    return "<No author tag found>";
}

=head2 leader()

Returns the leader for the record.  Sets the leader if I<text> is defined.
No error checking is done on the validity of the leader.

=cut

sub leader {
    my $self = shift;
    my $text = shift;

    if ( defined $text ) {
    	(length($text) eq 24)
	    or $self->_warn( "Leader must be 24 bytes long" );
	$self->{_leader} = $text;
    } # set the leader

    return $self->{_leader};
} # leader()

=head2 set_leader_lengths( $reclen, $baseaddr )

Internal function for updating the leader's length and base address.

=cut

sub set_leader_lengths {
    my $self = shift;
    my $reclen = shift;
    my $baseaddr = shift;
    substr($self->{_leader},0,5)  = sprintf("%05d",$reclen);
    substr($self->{_leader},12,5) = sprintf("%05d",$baseaddr);
}

=head2 clone()

The C<clone()> method makes a copy of an existing MARC record and returns
the new version.  Note that you cannot just say:

    my $newmarc = $oldmarc;

This just makes a copy of the reference, not a new object.  You must use
the C<clone()> method like so:

    my $newmarc = $oldmarc->clone;

You can also specify field specs to filter down only a 
certain subset of fields.  For instance, if you only wanted the
title and ISBN tags from a record, you could do this:

    my $small_marc = $marc->clone( 245, '020' );

The order of the fields is preserved as it was in the original record.

=cut

sub clone {
    my $self = shift;
    my @keeper_tags = @_;

    my $clone = $self->new();
    $clone->{_leader} = $self->{_leader};

    my $filtered = @keeper_tags ? [$self->field( @keeper_tags )] : undef;

    for my $field ( $self->fields() ) {
        if ( !$filtered || (grep {$field eq $_} @$filtered ) ) {
	    $clone->add_fields( $field->clone );
        }
    }

    # XXX FIX THIS $clone->update_leader();

    return $clone;
}

=head2 warnings()

Returns the warnings that were created when the record was read.
These are things like "Invalid indicators converted to blanks".

The warnings are items that you might be interested in, or might
not.  It depends on how stringently you're checking data.  If
you're doing some grunt data analysis, you probably don't care.

A side effect of calling warnings() is that the warning buffer will
be cleared.

=cut

sub warnings() {
    my $self = shift;
    my @warnings = @{$self->{_warnings}};
    $self->{_warnings} = []; 
    return @warnings;
}

=head2 add_fields()

C<add_fields()> is now deprecated, and users are encouraged to use 
C<append_fields()>, C<insert_fields_after()>, and C<insert_fields_before()> 
since they do what you want probably. It is still here though, for backwards 
compatability.

C<add_fields()> adds MARC::Field objects to the end of the list.  Returns the 
number of fields added, or C<undef> if there was an error.

There are three ways of calling C<add_fields()> to add data to the record.

=over 4

=item 1 Create a MARC::Field object and add it

  my $author = MARC::Field->new(
	        100, "1", " ", a => "Arnosky, Jim."
	        );
  $marc->add_fields( $author );

=item 2 Add the data fields directly, and let C<add_fields()> take care of the objectifying.

  $marc->add_fields(
        245, "1", "0",
                a => "Raccoons and ripe corn /",
                c => "Jim Arnosky.",
        	);

=item 3 Same as #2 above, but pass multiple fields of data in anonymous lists

  $marc->add_fields(
	[ 250, " ", " ", a => "1st ed." ],
	[ 650, "1", " ", a => "Raccoons." ],
	);

=back

=cut

sub add_fields {
    my $self = shift;

    my $nfields = 0;
    my $fields = $self->{_fields};

    while ( my $parm = shift ) {
	# User handed us a list of data (most common possibility)
	if ( ref($parm) eq "" ) {
	    my $field = MARC::Field->new( $parm, @_ )
		    or return _gripe( $MARC::Field::ERROR );
	    push( @$fields, $field );
	    ++$nfields;
	    last; # Bail out, we're done eating parms

	# User handed us an object.
	} elsif ( ref($parm) eq "MARC::Field" ) {
	    push( @$fields, $parm );
	    ++$nfields;

	# User handed us an anonymous list of parms
	} elsif ( ref($parm) eq "ARRAY" ) {
	    my $field = MARC::Field->new(@$parm) 
		or return _gripe( $MARC::Field::ERROR );
	    push( @$fields, $field );
	    ++$nfields;

	} else {
	    croak( "Unknown parm of type", ref($parm), " passed to add_fields()" );
	} # if

    } # while

    return $nfields;
}

# NOTE: _warn is an object method
sub _warn {
    my $self = shift;
    push( @{$self->{_warnings}}, join( "", @_ ) );
    return($self);
}


# NOTE: _gripe is NOT an object method
sub _gripe {
    $ERROR = join( "", @_ );

    warn $ERROR;

    return undef;
}

=head1 DESIGN NOTES

A brief discussion of why MARC::Record is done the way it is:

=over 4

=item * It's built for quick prototyping

One of the areas Perl excels is in allowing the programmer to 
create easy solutions quickly.  MARC::Record is designed along
those same lines.  You want a program to dump all the 6XX
tags in a file?  MARC::Record is your friend.

=item * It's built for extensibility

Currently, I'm using MARC::Record for analyzing bibliographic
data, but who knows what might happen in the future?  MARC::Record
needs to be just as adept at authority data, too.

=item * It's designed around accessor methods

I use method calls everywhere, and I expect calling programs to do
the same, rather than accessing internal data directly.  If you
access an object's hash fields on your own, future releases may
break your code.

=item * It's not built for speed

One of the tradeoffs in using accessor methods is some overhead
in the method calls.  Is this slow?  I don't know, I haven't measured.
I would suggest that if you're a cycle junkie that you use
Benchmark.pm to check to see where your bottlenecks are, and then
decide if MARC::Record is for you.
